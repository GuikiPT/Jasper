<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

**Purpose**

Test words or phrases against the bot's automod rules to determine if they would be flagged or allowed.

**Where it works**

- Guild channels

**Permissions**

- Allowed Staff Roles
- Allowed Admin Roles

**Options**

- `content` (string, required): The word or phrase to check against automod rules (max 1000 characters).
- `ephemeral` (boolean, optional): Whether the response should be visible only to you. Defaults to `true`.

**Syntax**

`/automod-check content:"text to check" [ephemeral:true|false]`

**Examples**

```
/automod-check content:"discord.gg/test"
/automod-check content:"those clankers bro" ephemeral:false

/automod-check content:"check out https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/123.png"
/automod-check content:"I love custard pie"
```

**Response Format**

The command displays results in two color-coded containers:
- **Container 1**: Shows the checked content (neutral color)
- **Container 2**: Shows the result with color coding (red for blocked, green for clean/allowed)

**Response Types**

- 🚫 **BLOCKED**: Content would be flagged by automod with details about which rule and pattern matched
- ✅ **ALLOWED**: Content is explicitly allowed despite matching a pattern, with exception details
- ✅ **CLEAN**: Content passes all automod checks with no violations detected

**Rule Categories**

The system checks against 5 comprehensive rule categories:

1. **Spoiler spam, markdown, soundmojis, staff ping** (63 blocked words, 10 regex patterns, 2 allowed exceptions)
   - Staff member pings and mentions
   - Special Unicode characters and formatting abuse
   - Soundmoji patterns and markdown manipulation
   - IP addresses and phone number links

2. **Soft Custom Keywords (with Links)** (114 blocked words, 3 regex patterns, 39 allowed exceptions)
   - Malicious domains and URL shorteners
   - Inappropriate content and mild profanity
   - Discord invite links (with NTTS server exceptions)
   - Scam and phishing patterns

3. **Medium Custom Keywords** (106 blocked words, 1 regex pattern, 45 allowed exceptions)
   - Sexual content and adult terminology
   - Moderate offensive language
   - Adult websites and services
   - Phone number detection patterns

4. **Hard Custom Keywords** (99 blocked words, 1 regex pattern, 18 allowed exceptions)
   - Racial slurs and hate speech
   - Severe offensive language
   - Advanced slur detection patterns
   - Nazi and discriminatory symbols

5. **Scam Nuker** (21 blocked words, 8 regex patterns, 1 allowed exception)
   - Known scam domains and services
   - Fake giveaway and nitro drop links
   - Malicious Steam community links
   - Complex scam link detection patterns

**Match Types**

- **Word/Phrase**: Direct text matches with wildcard support (`*`)
- **Regex Pattern**: Advanced pattern matching for complex rules
- **Special Character Handling**: Proper detection of Discord mentions, URLs, and special characters

**Notes**

- Rules are processed in order (1-5) and the first match determines the result
- Allowed words take precedence over blocked words within the same rule
- Uses word boundaries for normal text and contains matching for special characters
- Does not check for bypasses or obfuscation attempts
- Results display rule ID, name, match type, and specific pattern that triggered

**Technical Details**

- **Total Coverage**: 403 blocked words, 23 regex patterns, 105 allowed exceptions
- **Pattern Matching**: Uses word boundaries for normal text, contains matching for Discord mentions and URLs
- **Rule Processing**: Sequential evaluation (Rule 1→5), first match wins
- **Wildcard Support**: `*` wildcards supported in blocked/allowed words (e.g., `clanker*` matches `clankers`, `clankering`)
- **Exception Handling**: Allowed words override blocked words within the same rule
- **Performance**: Optimized for real-time checking with minimal false positives

**Use Cases**

- **Content Moderation**: Test if user messages would trigger automod
- **Rule Validation**: Verify new rules work as expected before deployment
- **Exception Testing**: Confirm allowed words bypass blocks correctly
- **Staff Training**: Help moderators understand what content gets flagged
- **Policy Development**: Analyze rule effectiveness and coverage gaps

**Options**

- None

**Syntax**

`/topic` | `j!topic`

**Cooldown**

- Only allowed staff or admins can call this command.

</details>

<a id="topic-ai"></a>
### `/topic-ai`

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

**Purpose**

- Guild channels

**Permissions**

- Allowed Staff Roles
- Allowed Admin Roles
- Manage Server (Discord permission, implicit)

**Options**

**Syntax**

`/topic-ai [prompt:"theme"]` | `j!topic-ai [theme]`

**Cooldown**

- 2 uses per 10 seconds per channel

**AI Providers**

The command supports three AI providers (configured via `AI_PROVIDER` environment variable):

- **Groq** (`groq`): Fastest inference with generous free tier
- **Google Gemini** (`gemini`): Reliable cloud-based AI (default)
- **Ollama** (`ollama`): Self-hosted for privacy and no rate limits

**Features**

- **AI Generation**: Uses selected AI provider to generate creative, rule-compliant topics
- **Two-Layer Security**: 
  - Regex pattern matching catches obvious prompt injection attempts
  - AI semantic validation ensures prompt is legitimate theme, not malicious instructions
- **Approval Workflow**: 
  - Moderators see generated topic with three buttons: Approve, Regenerate, Reject
  - 2-minute timeout for decision
  - Only the moderator who triggered the command can interact with buttons
- **Rule Compliance**: 
  - Enforces community rules (no NSFW, politics, religion, controversy)
  - Topics are family-friendly and appropriate for all ages
  - Maintains positive, respectful, inclusive tone
- **History Tracking**: 
  - Approved topics saved to database
  - Rejected topics tracked to avoid regeneration
  - AI avoids generating similar or previously used topics (tracks last 150)
- **Smart Deduplication**: Prevents repeating topics from manual list, approved AI topics, or rejected AI topics
- **User-Friendly Errors**: Clean error messages for rate limits, auth failures, network issues

**Security Protections**

The command includes multiple layers of protection against prompt injection:

1. **Regex Sanitization**: Detects patterns like "ignore instructions", "act as", "you are now"
2. **AI Validation**: Uses AI to extract only legitimate themes, rejecting malicious instructions
3. **Rule Enforcement**: AI system prompt cannot be overridden by user input
4. **Max Length**: Topics limited to 200 characters
5. **Approval Gate**: Human moderator must approve before posting

**Configuration**

Set `AI_PROVIDER` in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Choose provider: 'groq', 'gemini', or 'ollama'
AI_PROVIDER=groq

# Groq Configuration
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_key_here
GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile  # optional

# Gemini Configuration
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Ollama Configuration (self-hosted)
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://ollama:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2  # optional
```

**Notes**

- Moderators see ephemeral preview before topic is posted publicly
- Approved topics are added to the guild's AI topic history
- Rejected topics are remembered to prevent regeneration
- Button timeout: 2 minutes
- Only one provider is used per request (no fallback chain)
- See [AI_PROVIDER_QUICKSTART.md](../AI_PROVIDER_QUICKSTART.md) for setup guide

## Settings Commands

The `/settings` command configures guild-specific behavior. Most actions are available as both slash and message commands. Where "Manage Server" is noted, users with that Discord permission may also execute the action.

### Quick Reference

| Category | Base Command | Subcommands |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prefixes | `/settings prefixes` | `set`, `view` |
| Roles | `/settings roles` | `add`, `remove`, `list` |
| Channels | `/settings channels` | `add`, `remove`, `list` |
| Topics | `/settings topics` | `add`, `remove`, `list`, `import`, `export` |
| Support | `/settings support` | `set`, `view` |
| Slowmode | `/settings slowmode` | `view`, `configure` |
| YouTube | `/settings youtube` | `enable`, `disable`, `view`, `test`, `force-update` |

### Prefixes (`/settings prefixes`)

Configures the guild-specific message prefix used for Jasper's message commands.

**Subcommands**
- [`/settings prefixes set`](#settings-prefixes-set) - Set the message command prefix for the guild.
- [`/settings prefixes view`](#settings-prefixes-view) - Show the active prefix.

<a id="settings-prefixes-set"></a>
#### `/settings prefixes set`

<details>

**Permissions**

- Allowed Admin Roles (Administrator also permitted).

**Options**

**Additional Notes**

- **Prefix Updated**: After changing the prefix, Jasper sends a confirmation summarizing the old and new prefixes. Slash commands keep working, and the message prefix switches immediately.

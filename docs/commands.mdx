# Commands Catalogue

This page documents every Jasper Revamp command with concise, authoritative details taken from the bot codebase. It focuses on what each command does, where it works, what permissions are needed, and which options it accepts.

Notes

- Examples and visual message previews have been intentionally removed.
- "Allowed" role buckets refer to categories configured via `/settings roles`.
- Message (prefix) commands use your configured prefix (default: `j!`).

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

Test words or phrases against the bot's automod rules to determine if they would be flagged or allowed.

**Where it works**

- Guild channels

**Permissions**

- Allowed Staff Roles
- Allowed Admin Roles

**Options**

- `content` (string, required): The word or phrase to check against automod rules (max 1000 characters).
- `ephemeral` (boolean, optional): Whether the response should be visible only to you. Defaults to `true`.

**Syntax**

`/automod-check content:"text to check" [ephemeral:true|false]`

**Examples**

```
/automod-check content:"discord.gg/test"
/automod-check content:"those clankers bro" ephemeral:false
/automod-check content:"hey <@1152813525912264834>"
/automod-check content:"check out https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/123.png"
/automod-check content:"I love custard pie"
```

**Response Format**

The command displays results in two color-coded containers:
- **Container 1**: Shows the checked content (neutral color)
- **Container 2**: Shows the result with color coding (red for blocked, green for clean/allowed)

**Response Types**

- 🚫 **BLOCKED**: Content would be flagged by automod with details about which rule and pattern matched
- ✅ **ALLOWED**: Content is explicitly allowed despite matching a pattern, with exception details
- ✅ **CLEAN**: Content passes all automod checks with no violations detected

**Rule Categories**

The system checks against 5 comprehensive rule categories:

1. **Spoiler spam, markdown, soundmojis, staff ping** (63 blocked words, 10 regex patterns, 2 allowed exceptions)
   - Staff member pings and mentions
   - Special Unicode characters and formatting abuse
   - Soundmoji patterns and markdown manipulation
   - IP addresses and phone number links

2. **Soft Custom Keywords (with Links)** (114 blocked words, 3 regex patterns, 39 allowed exceptions)
   - Malicious domains and URL shorteners
   - Inappropriate content and mild profanity
   - Discord invite links (with NTTS server exceptions)
   - Scam and phishing patterns

3. **Medium Custom Keywords** (106 blocked words, 1 regex pattern, 45 allowed exceptions)
   - Sexual content and adult terminology
   - Moderate offensive language
   - Adult websites and services
   - Phone number detection patterns

4. **Hard Custom Keywords** (99 blocked words, 1 regex pattern, 18 allowed exceptions)
   - Racial slurs and hate speech
   - Severe offensive language
   - Advanced slur detection patterns
   - Nazi and discriminatory symbols

5. **Scam Nuker** (21 blocked words, 8 regex patterns, 1 allowed exception)
   - Known scam domains and services
   - Fake giveaway and nitro drop links
   - Malicious Steam community links
   - Complex scam link detection patterns

**Match Types**

- **Word/Phrase**: Direct text matches with wildcard support (`*`)
- **Regex Pattern**: Advanced pattern matching for complex rules
- **Special Character Handling**: Proper detection of Discord mentions, URLs, and special characters

**Notes**

- Rules are processed in order (1-5) and the first match determines the result
- Allowed words take precedence over blocked words within the same rule
- Uses word boundaries for normal text and contains matching for special characters
- Does not check for bypasses or obfuscation attempts
- Results display rule ID, name, match type, and specific pattern that triggered

**Technical Details**

- **Total Coverage**: 403 blocked words, 23 regex patterns, 105 allowed exceptions
- **Pattern Matching**: Uses word boundaries for normal text, contains matching for Discord mentions and URLs
- **Rule Processing**: Sequential evaluation (Rule 1→5), first match wins
- **Wildcard Support**: `*` wildcards supported in blocked/allowed words (e.g., `clanker*` matches `clankers`, `clankering`)
- **Exception Handling**: Allowed words override blocked words within the same rule
- **Performance**: Optimized for real-time checking with minimal false positives

**Use Cases**

- **Content Moderation**: Test if user messages would trigger automod
- **Rule Validation**: Verify new rules work as expected before deployment
- **Exception Testing**: Confirm allowed words bypass blocks correctly
- **Staff Training**: Help moderators understand what content gets flagged
- **Policy Development**: Analyze rule effectiveness and coverage gaps
